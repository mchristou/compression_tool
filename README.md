# Compression Tool

A simple command-line tool for encoding and decoding files using Huffman coding.

## Usage

### Encoding

To encode a file, use the following command:
```
compression-tool -e --input <input_file>
```

This will generate a compressed binary file named "compressed.bin."

### Decoding

To decode a file, use the following command:
```
compression-tool -d --input <compressed_file>
```
This will generate a text file named "output.txt."
